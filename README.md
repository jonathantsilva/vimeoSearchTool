# Vimeo Search Tool
Some time ago i found an vulnerability in websites who uses vimeo as course platform.

My intention was elucidate this and exploit the vulnerability.

This tool was made with javascript and jQuery a long time ago (4 years).

If I had time I'll improve the code.

# How to use
- Install some extension to disable CORS on your browser, 
  I used  Allow-Control-Allow-Origin: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi?hl=pt-BR  
- Install tampermokey and create a new script
